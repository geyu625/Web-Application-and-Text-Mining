Web-Application-and-Text-Mining
===============================
HUD- approved housing counseling agencies provide advice on buying a home, defaults, foreclosure and credit issues. Reading the review information of these agencies could be time- consuming for clients. This project performed a text mining on the mimic review data of housing counseling agencies and extracted useful adjectives and verb phrases to best evaluate agency's performance. Additionally, to meet the requirement of Dodd-Frank Finance Reform Bill, this project created a web application which displays the information of certain housing counseling agencies based on the zip code of clients. The displayed information includes agency name, service provided, review summary and distance to the zip code. This web application could be integrated into the loan system of financial institutes to provide an insight of housing counseling agencies to clients. Both text mining on review data and creating a web application are on Java platform.
